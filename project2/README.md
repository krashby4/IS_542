# Project 2: My Learning Experience with animations and CSS
- So getting things to animate in the Scriptures app was rather difficult. I wasn't able to get anything to work until I got some help from fellow classmate Riley Hales. In the end I opted to adopt his way of doing things since I was having no luck with my methods (they all turned into dead ends, more or less). Maybe if I was able to construct something from the ground up I could better get a handle on animating certain elements but for this assignment I had a real tough time.
- I implemented using modules in my code, which I think is super helpful in organization. Instead of panning, scanning and intensely searching for a bit of code I need to change, I can open up the appropriate module and quickly find what I need to change. It also makes more sense in my head seeing seperate functionalities divided out and contained rather than having a large script file
- CSS was also a bit of a challenge but I think I made a somewhat responsive layout. It isn't much, basically if you're viewing it on a small device or not. And the layout design isn't all that original (just stacking the scriptures and map on top of each other vs side by side). But I think it makes the most sense, given the content and whatnot.
